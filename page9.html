				<p>Kobe Bryant was an American professional basketball player who spent his entire 20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers, winning five NBA championships and becoming one of the most influential players in history. Born in 1978, he was drafted directly out of high school in 1996 and, alongside teammate Shaquille O'Neal, led the Lakers to three consecutive championships from 2000 to 2002. Bryant's career was marked by numerous accolades, including being a 18-time All-Star and the 2008 NBA MVP, before he retired in 2016. He tragically died in a helicopter crash in 2020.  </p>
